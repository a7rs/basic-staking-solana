# Simple Staking Program

*Disclaimer: Open source version of this code is unaudited an unmaintained. Use at your own risk.*

## Purpose
The purpose of this program is to enable simple deployment of a basic staking program.

## Methodology
This staking program does not mint a "reciprocal token" i.e. if the stake token is ABC, the staking
program will not create and mint ABCX tokens to represent a staker's proportional ownership.
